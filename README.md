# Data-coordinatesRepro_22-23-24
Data were collected as part of a long-term monitoring on Kakrarahu islet, Estonia. Data include nest locations of several species breeding on the islet, as well as reproductive data for Common gulls.

- species: Corresponding bird species of the nest
- accuracy: Estimated accuracy of the nest location (meters)
- latitude: Geographic latitude (WGS84 coordinates)
- longitude: Geographic longitude (WGS84 coordinates)
- latitude_eesti: Latitude in Estonian coordinate system
- longitude_eesti: Longitude in Estonian coordinate system
- eggsLayed: Number of eggs laid 
- eggsHatched: Number of eggs hatched
- eggsMissing: Number of eggs missing
- eggsPredated: Number of eggs lost due to predation
- eggsPredatedorMissing:  Number of eggs either predated or missing

- first_egg_date: Date when the first egg was laid
- ProbaChick: Probability that the nest has at least one chick
- hatchingSuccess: Hatching success rate (number of eggs hatched/number of eggs laid)
- height_m: Elevation of nests
- singleClutch: Indicator if nest was a 2nd clutch or not (yes/no)
- dist_2_main_islet: Distance from the main islet (meters)
- distance_to_nearest_tern_zone_m: Distance to the nearest tern breeding area (meters)
